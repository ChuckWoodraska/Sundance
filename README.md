# Sundance
Sundance is a machine learning project that contains three parts to generate, predict, and present info on whether you should wear a jacket today or not.

Sundance.py is the file used to generate data for the day that you would run on some sort of schedule or cron.
Sundance_mom.py is the file used to predict whether or not you should wear a jacket.
Sundance_front.py presents info on the current weather data and if you should bring a jacket with you today.
